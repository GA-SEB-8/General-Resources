# Tips and Tricks

### AKA How This Course Works and How to Succeed

## How to succeed in the SEB

Read through the following.  Write down five things that you learned from reading this.  Write down five things that you plan to work on while taking this class.

### Abandon your concepts of how education works

- High School/College is built to work very differently from a bootcamp
- traditional education is built upon the idea that students don't want to be there.
- consequently, we have grades
- we become enslaved to other people's evaluation of ourselves and develop no internal motivation of our own
- Learning to code is VERY different from learning most subjects

### Focus just on what you're working on today.  If you expand to the big picture, it can be overwhelming

- Knowledge really settles in during project time. The REAL learning comes during project week...

### Homework

- Start with easy questions.  If you're struggling with something, skip the question and try the next one
- As soon as class is over, review the HW quickly.  Gather a list of questions for the TA and add yourself to the queue as soon as they get on
- Check your homework by figuring out ways to test your answers to see if they are correct.  Don't wait for feedback.
- You should be able to answer the question "did I do it right?" on your own.
- In the real world, you'll need to figure out how to test your code to see if it works.  You won't have someone to read your code and tell you if you did it right.
- There is no "best" solution.  Ultimately, the only thing that matters is, "does it work?"
- Code "quality" (how you write code) doesn't matter (much) as a jr developer.  Only your ability to solve problems matters.
- Ask specific questions regarding the feedback you want to receive.  Otherwise we will just check for completeness.

### Nothing is difficult, just unfamiliar

### Don't be afraid to ask questions or let us know when you're stuck

- Don't attempt to "catch up" on your own
- You'll just fall further behind
- Our notes are meant to be a reference for later, not a step by step guide
- All this material is online. You could teach all of it to yourself, but it's incredibly difficult. You're basically paying a bunch of money to have the curated curriculum and instructors around to guide you through it. Being a developer is about teaching yourself. This experience is immersive because we simulate a real world environment of self directed learning but we provide significant scaffolding and guidance. We are here to teach you HOW to teach yourself and to compress what you would take you years to figure out on your own.

### Intensity, intensity, intensity

- Typically we find that the students who take longer than 6 months to find a job are the ones that didn't work very hard, NOT the ones with less experience or "intelligence".
- Students who succeed create a community within the cohort, they together and code/commiserate together
- Students who succeed dedicate 70+ hours a week to the course.
- Students who succeed take time to take care of themselves

- we are the bottom picture
- you're not going to leave this class with total fluency. There is simply too much to learn. This course is like the first 1000 words you need in order to survive in the "country" and the tools to teach yourselves the rest. It's up to you to practice using those tools from day 1.
- imagine being dropped in a country with no knowledge of the language, how much would you have learned in 3 months?

### Don't focus on getting the certificate, focus on learning as much as possible

- GA credentials mean nothing
- no one will bring you in for an interview because you went to a bootcamp
- GA is not Stanford or MIT.  Nobody will be impressed with the GA name on your resume
- Bootcamps have not been around long enough to gain any clout
- The value of his cohort is the practical knowledge and practice you gain from doing it
- The most important skill is your ability to problem solve and talk thoughtfully about your process

### Figure out what kind of learner you are

- Each person learns differently
- What might have worked for you in one class might not work here
- Think about how you learn and be aware of what works/doesn't work
- Try to code along or take notes while we code.  If that isn't working for you try to just listen and absorb, then code along with the lecture recording later.
- If that doesn't work, try the opposite or some variation.

### Ways to avoid distraction

- Change your voicemail to let people know you will not be able to respond immediately
- Set auto reply to email to let people know you will not be able to respond immediately
- Tell your friends and family what you are doing.  Tell them you'll be busier than you've ever been and may not see them much for 12 weeks.
- Deactivate social media
- Turn off your phone during class time and while doing homework

- Try to create a relationship with all other students. You don't know when you'll need a second set of eyes. Sometimes bugs are really stupid, and can be spotted by anyone.  It's like writing an essay where your eyes know what you're trying to say and don't see mistakes

- Finding a job has a lot to do with timing, what the employer needs vs what the student wants to do, and personality matches. Because of this, it's never that the best students get jobs first.  Rather, the group who get jobs first will contain a diverse set of students.  This group of students who get jobs first are often a way into a company for others, so be friends with everyone.  Someone you think would be unlikely to get a job could be one of the first ones to get one and could help you out.

### growth mindset vs fixed mindset

- growth mindset
- people who believe that ability can be learned are highly successful
- fixed mindset
- people believe that ability is something you're born with are not successful
- focus on the learning process, not on the results of your current task
- you'll succeed more and have more fun
- different types of fixed mindsets.  Monitor your reactions for these feelings:
- You’re Wrong I Rule: person is unable to accept that they did something wrong
- You’re Right I Suck: any criticism immediately sends person into feeling like they're worthless
- Blame it On The Rain: any mistake a person makes is explained away by circumstance.  The person believes this won't happen again, so there's no need to correct the issue
- Optimist Without a Cause: criticism is not important, given everything else that went well

### Programming is like writing an essay in a language you don't know.  Know what you want to say and then research how to say it

### come up with the solution to a problem on your own and then research any syntax you might need in order to implement it.  Do not research the answer to the problem itself

- Help out everyone.  IAs are often chosen by those who help other students a lot during class

### Project weeks

- community bonding time.  Help each other out
- a chance to simulate the real world and see where you need improvement
- this is where you'll get a lot of practice with researching and debugging
- hand-holding during this time leads to less independence in the real world

### Bringing up your mistakes during class often illuminates good points to talk about

- it's very difficult as an instructor to come up with scenarios where a student will make a mistake, since everyone makes different kinds of mistakes

### Practice learning on your own

- This will be your life when you start work
- the chances that you'll be using the exact tech we teach you is slim even though we pick popular tech to teach
- the concepts that we teach will be the same for your entire life
- tech changes, concepts don't
- We teach you to teach yourself and provide hints along the way
- Most of development is coming across something you've never seen and figuring it out on your own
- Don't worry about what is the most optimal thing to study.  As long as you're focused, whatever you study will be great

### Projects and grades mean nothing

- No interviewer will be impressed by your projects or your grades alone.  That's because you're still just starting out as a developer
- They will, however, be impressed if you can answer interview questions and talk thoughtfully about your code
- The education and knowledge you gain from projects, homework, labs, etc is what will get you past an interview.  Not the actual work itself

### Don't compare yourself with other students. This is not school, where everyone comes in with roughly equivalent experience

- There is plenty of work available for graduates at all levels, as long as you fully understand the work you present to employers

- Don't let problems/questions of any kind (programming or personal) fester. Bring them up immediately to an IA or an IL
- We only "open the doors" you have to walk through the door.  We guide you, but you'll have to do most of the work.

- It's like bowling.  We're the bumpers, but you have the throw the ball

- Learning how to debug your own code and read documentation/articles/forums takes practice.  This is not really something that can be taught.  Make sure you struggle and read a lot on the internet on your own time.  Don't immediately ask for help
- Development is like creating a recipe, it's just a series of basic steps
- Learn what kind of mistakes you make
- Type things out, don't copy and paste.  Copy and pasting takes your mind off of what you're doing.
- There is a disconnect between knowing something at a conceptual level and being able to use it.  Make sure you can do both

- Just because you can look at code and understand it, doesn't mean you can build something like it
- It's like having the recipe for baking a really complex desert.  Just because you have the steps, doesn't mean it won't burn

- We create increasing levels of independence: lecture (very hands on) -> lab -> homework -> project (very hands off)

- This is to ease you into what it will be like in real life

- Your community of students is the best aspect of GA. They will help you with finding work and help you when you are stuck on a problem at work

- Explaining something to someone else is the best way to fully understand something
- Learners teaching learners is stressed in educational books
- There will always be some kind of a disconnect between someone with more experience and someone with less experience.
- This is especially pronounced here where months later you're a completely different person
  - ILs, IAs, and TAs are great, but nothing beats talking with someone in the same position as you

### Share your bugs and mistakes

- Prepares everyone for finding mistakes in other people's code

- Class restrictions like attendance might seem silly, but we're trying to produce people who can show up on time for a meeting. Soft skills.

- Doesn't matter whether or not you can code if you can't show up on time to your commitments

### Try to fail as much as possible now

- It will prepare you for being calm while failing on job
- Attitude is very important when working
- Most companies will not tolerate someone who freaks out or gets nasty during times of stress
- It will make you faster at finding your own faults

- What you really get out of this class: learning to learn, being methodical, reading tech docs, debugging, and how to stay calm under pressure
- If class is moving too slowly, talk to us and we will give you more advanced material
- Anyone can do this.  We've had all walks of life and backgrounds succeed in this course.
