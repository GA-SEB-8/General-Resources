# What to do after the bootcamp has finished

Congratulations for finishing the bootcamp! You should be super proud of getting this far.

One of the fantastic advantages of a bootcamp is that you learn an incredible amount of stuff in a really short ammount of time. Unfortunately the downside of a bootcamp is that you can lose the knowledge just as quickly as you gained it.

I have put some ideas below on how to ensure you don't lose the knowledge that you gained at GA.

## Start project 5

Pick a technology that you learnt during the course e.g. MEN, MERN, Django, React. and build another project with that stack. Just remember that every problem can be solved, but you'll just need to solve them yourself using google and the docs. Create a project that you are proud of and if you face a roadblock, work at it until you have overcome that roadblock.

## Get Good at Codewars

This is by far the best way to get good at "problem solving" also it works very similarly to how many tecnical interviews work too. https://www.codewars.com/dashboard

Keep your brain working by completing the 7-8 kyu challenges. If you're feeling ambitious try a 6kyu, but if it's too hard and you can't do it, don't get disheartened, just skip it and go back to a 7.

Also remember Codewars rewards people for 'looking cool' and making completely unreadable but clever 1 liner answers. Make sure you read these solutions as they can be quite eye opening but understand that they are rarely 'best practice'. the best solution is the one that works, and is the easiest to read!

## Try Hackerrank

Hackerrank is a little bit like codewars, but with a more structured approach. You can practice your skills here: https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard and they even have certifications: https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-verification. The certifications don't actually 'mean' anything but they give you the opportunity to check your knowledge and show the level you're at. They look great on linked in too!

## Try Leetcode

Leetcode is used by lots of companies for tech tests. Their challenges range from easy to downright mind bending! Leetcode isn't my personal favourite but some people prefer it to codewars, and Hackerrank. https://leetcode.com/

## Should you learn another language?

Now my personal advice is no. Stick with getting good at what you already know. There's still lots to learn in JavaScript, Loads more to ket good at with CSS, We've barely scratched the surface of Python, and Django has so much more to it that we could possibly cover. Also React is really massive.

If you are going for an interview at a company that uses another language e.g. Java, Go, Rust, PHP, etc. it would be worth doing a quick crash course in one of those languages just so that you aren't going to the interview with no knowledge whatsoever.

However if for example you just really really want to learn another specific language for some reason then go ahead. After my bootcamp I challenged myself to learn Rust and it was a really eye opening experience. I'm not saying "Don't learn another language" I'm just suggesting you don't prioritise it over practicing languages you already know.

Good luck!
